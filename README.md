### Question | fde-capu
After a clean install of Debian 12, I would like to save all my current system state of installations: installed softwares, program configurations, as well as uninstalled softeare, updates, manually installed apps, etc.. I am using Cinnamon Desktop, if that matters, though it should not, since the solution (I think) should work for any Linux distribution. How do I accomplish the saving of all adulteration and customization of a clean installation of a Linux system into a separate file, say in a pendrive, so I could easy pull out a single script to revert any new installation into my custom one?

### Answer | gpt-4 Model
To save the current state of your Debian 12 system, including installed software, configurations, updates, and manually installed apps, you can create a shell script that automates the process of replicating your customized system. You can store this script in a separate file on a pendrive or any other storage device.

First, create a list of all installed packages using the following command:

```
dpkg --get-selections  >  installed_packages.list
```

This will generate a file called `installed_packages.list` containing all installed packages on your system.

Next, create a shell script that will automate the process of installing these packages on a new system. You can name the script `restore_packages.sh` and include the following content:

```
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo dpkg --set-selections  <  installed_packages.list
sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade
```

Make the script executable by running the following command:

```
chmod +x restore_packages.sh
```

Now, you can copy both `installed_packages.list` and `restore_packages.sh` to your pendrive. When you want to restore your customizations on a new Debian 12 installation, simply run the `restore_packages.sh` script from the pendrive:

```
./restore_packages.sh
```

This script will update the system, upgrade packages, and install the packages listed in `installed_packages.list`. Note that this solution covers the installed software and their configurations, but you may need to manually copy files and directories for certain programs or customizations that are not covered by package management.

I want one-script-to-do-it-all; so even though you gave me a partial solution, I would still need to take other actions, so what are those? Is this question of mine anything different from building a distro? In this case, is there any quick-and-dirty single command to transform my whole system into a re-instalable Linux?

To create a one-script solution that covers all aspects of your system, including software packages, configurations, and customizations, you can use a combination of the previous solution and additional steps to backup and restore configuration files and customizations.

As before, create a list of all installed packages:

```
dpkg --get-selections  >  installed_packages.list
```

Backup your configuration files and customizations. For example, you can create a tarball of your `/etc` and `/home` directories:

```
sudo tar -cvpzf config_and_customizations.tar.gz /etc /home
```

Create a shell script named `restore_system.sh` that automates the installation of packages and restoration of configurations:

```
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo dpkg --set-selections  <  installed_packages.list
sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade
# Extract the configuration files and customizations
sudo tar -xvpzf config_and_customizations.tar.gz -C /
```

Make the script executable:

```
chmod +x restore_system.sh
```

Copy the `installed_packages.list`, `config_and_customizations.tar.gz`, and `restore_system.sh` files to your pendrive.

To restore your customizations on a new Debian 12 installation, run the `restore_system.sh` script from the pendrive:

```
./restore_system.sh
```

This script will update the system, upgrade packages, install the packages listed in `installed_packages.list`, and restore the configurations and customizations from the `config_and_customizations.tar.gz` file.

Please note that this approach may have some limitations, such as potential incompatibilities between different versions of software or configurations. However, it provides a quick and relatively comprehensive way to restore your custom Debian 12 system.

Regarding the question about building a distro, creating a custom distribution or a respin can be more complex and time-consuming than the solution provided above. It involves creating a custom ISO image with all the required software and customizations pre-installed. If you're interested in learning more about creating a custom distribution, you can look into tools like  or . However, for your specific use case, the one-script solution should be sufficient to restore your customizations on a new Debian 12 installation.


### Question | fde-capu
My /home directory has personal files that I would not like to include in this full backup. From it, I want to automatically pick what is software related only; leaving the folders I have created myself out of it.
#### exclude personal files from system backup Linux

### Answer | gpt-4 Model
In order to create a backup that excludes your personal files and only includes software-related configurations and customizations, you can modify the backup step to exclude specific directories from the `/home` folder. You can use the `--exclude` option with the `tar` command to exclude specific directories or files.

First, create a list of directories to exclude from the backup. These should be the directories you've created yourself. For example:

```
/home/username/PersonalFolder1
/home/username/PersonalFolder2
```

Save this list of directories in a file called `exclude_dirs.txt`. Then, modify the tar command in the previous solution to exclude these directories when creating the backup:

```
sudo tar -cvpzf config_and_customizations.tar.gz --exclude-from=exclude_dirs.txt /etc /home
```

This command will create a tarball of the `/etc` and `/home` directories, excluding the directories listed in `exclude_dirs.txt`.

Now, you can follow the previous solution to create a one-script solution, but use the modified tar command to create the backup. This will ensure that your personal files are not included in the backup, and only software-related configurations and customizations are backed up.

Please note that this solution assumes that all software-related configurations are stored within the `/etc` and `/home` directories. If there are any additional folders containing important configurations, you may need to include them in the backup as well.
